git status (shows status in green if add in repo, but not commited yet. Slows in Red if changed made in local and not added to repo yet)
git diff (shows changes if file chages in local but not added to git yet)
git log --graph --decorate --oneline
git restore (revert back change in local if not added / commited to git yet)

git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"  (Created a tag)
git tag (List the tags)

To restore old code 
---------------------------------------
git log --oneline  // give commit id>>
git checkout <<commit_id >>  // Changes the local file content to represent the files status as in commit_id
git checkout master // makes the local file same as the head

undo commmit
------------------------------------------
git log --oneline  // give commit id>>
git reset --hard <<commit_id>>
This will set the head at the assigned commit_id, all the code checked in after that commit_id is lost from git and local

Collaboration with other // remote git
-----------------------------------------------
 git remote add origin https://github.com/surajit2k2/mergetest.git   // Create a new connection to a remote repository, the name by default is origin
 git push -u origin master  // Push code to remote repository and create a master branch in remote from local repo master branch 

 git branch // give branches in local repo, like master
 git branch -r // gives branches in remote repo, like origin/master ==> here origin denotes remote repo name and origin/master ==> master branch in origin repo
